# check_internet.py

**Code Analysis: Internet Connection Checker**

This Python script checks for an active internet connection and waits until it is available before running the main script.

**Key Functions:**

1. `check_internet()`: Attempts to connect to Google's DNS server (`8.8.8.8`) on port 53 with a 3-second timeout. If successful, returns `True`; otherwise, returns `False`.
2. Main Script: Waits for an internet connection by repeatedly calling `check_internet()` in a loop.

**Behavior:**

1. The script starts by trying to establish a connection to Google's DNS server.
2. If the connection is successful, the script exits with a status code of 0.
3. If the connection fails, the script enters a loop where it:
	* Prints a message indicating the current attempt number and the current time.
	* Waits for 60 seconds using `time.sleep(60)`.
	* Increments the attempt number by
